# libdbaserh 0.3
`libdbaserh` is a C library for device control and data acquisition of DigiBase-RH PMT bases.

The library is an adaption of `libdbase` 0.2 for DigiBase-RH modules.

`dbaserh.py` is a python wrapper for `libdbaserh`


The manufacturer's explanation of the difference between DigiBase and DigiBase-RH (April 2012):

>"RH version was designed to be more ruggedized against neutron damage which
> was a problem with its predecessor. When this change was made, much of the
> hardware and its method of communication changed as well."

## Development Status
- version 0.3 -- set of different zero and gain stabilization during
                 device initialization (file libdbaserhi.c),
                 modification of some of these parameters on the initialized
                 device is not working

- version 0.2 -- the detector status after init process changed
                 (real/live time preset to 0)

- version 0.1 -- initial version

##  To Do
- Write a comprehensive manual.
- Display actual HV
- Handle status messages (are there any?)

## Dependencies
- `libusb-1.0` for low-level USB communication

## Installation Instructions
1. Install `libusb-1.0`.
1. Locate `digiBaseRH.rbf` on the Windows system with the ORTEC DigiBase software installed (the default installation path seems to be C:\Windows\System32\digiBase.rbf).
    - Note: md5sum of digiBaseRH.rbf should be `8ef9cdf4eb72d234a8add7afee4963ba`
1. Copy this file to your Linux system and specify its path in the Makefile.
  (Note: Leave the capital 'B' in the filename, it should be 'digiBaseRH.rbf').
  This path will be hard coded into libdbase during compilation.
    - Recommended path: ```/usr/local/share/libdbaserh```
1. Move `dbaserh.rules` to ```/etc/udev/rules.d```
1. Compile the library: ```make```
1. Install the library: ```sudo make install```
1. Run c control program: ```sudo ./dbaserh```
1. Run python control program: ```python2 dbaserh.py```

## Acknowledgements
`libdbaserh` originally comes from [Jan Kamenik](mailto:jankamenik@gmail.com). It is an extension of `libdbase`, written by [Peder Kock](mailto:peder.kock@med.lu.se) and Jonas Nilsson,
Lund University. See http://libdbase.sourceforge.net for more information on `libdbase`.

`dbaserh.py` was written by Emily Frame (eaframe@berkeley.edu). It is a python wrapper for `libdbaserh` and is intended to
be more user-friendly.
